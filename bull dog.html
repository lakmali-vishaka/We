<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Bulldogs being origins since 1568 in Europe.In the anciant there was a game called bullbaiting.the dogs who well suited for this game called as "Bulldogs".

Bulldogs are a non-sporting  breed  bred to be affectionate companions.  The original Bulldog was fierce, brave, and felt little pain In 1835, dogfighting was outlawed as a sport in England. Thus, the Old English Bulldog lost its usefulness in England, 
and the age of the Bulldog breed was numbered in England Such dogs were used to preserve and accentuate the characteristics.In a few generations, the English Bulldog lost its original ferocity, endurance and speed, becoming one of the physical specimens. became one. Although their genetic origins are disputed, the original Bulldog is believed to have been bred in England as a cross between a Mastiff,
 Bandog and the  ancient English Pagnaces Britanniae. The original Old English Bulldog was eventually crossed with a Pug. The result was a shorter, broader bulldog with a brachycephalic
 head. While they look tough, today's English Bulldogs can't handle the rigors bulldogs run or throw from bulls, and can't handle such short muzzles, so they do the job for which this breed was originally created. I can't.


The Bulldog True Small English Bulldog was a continuation of the small breed of Bulldog that began in 1835 after  the sport of bull-his-bait was outlawed. Most purebred English Bulldogs are bred to be oversized here in the United States. It's not uncommon for a female Bulldog to weigh him between 65 and 85 pounds. Some of the breeders who come to our veterinary clinic  have female Bulldogs between 
90 and 100 lbs.Here at Shrinkables we breed purebred small English Bulldogs.
